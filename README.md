## Running a Go program


There are 2 ways to run a go program, the first one is long way: 

1.  In order to run a go program the first thing you need to do is compile it : 

```bash
$ go build file_name.go
```

This will create a binary file that you can run as follows:

```bash
$ ./file_name
```

2. The second one is the short way of doing the same thing above using the go run command which abstracts the compilation step :

```bash
$ go run file_name.go
```
